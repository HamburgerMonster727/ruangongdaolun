真值表：

|  A   |  B   |  F   |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  0   |  0   |  1   |
|  0   |  1   |  1   |
|  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  1   |  1   |



## 5) What is circuit equivalence? Use truth table to prove the following formula.  (AB)’ = A’ + B’

真值表：

|  A   |  B   | (AB)' | A'+B' |
| :--: | :--: | :---: | :---: |
|  0   |  0   |   1   |   1   |
|  0   |  1   |   1   |   1   |
|  1   |  0   |   1   |   1   |
|  1   |  1   |   0   |   0   |



## 6) There are eight 1bit full adder integrated circuits. Combine them to 8bit adder circuit using the following box diagram.

上一位的cout连到下一位的cin，以此类推。

## 7) Logical binary operations can be used to modify bit pattern. Such as (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1 )2 and (00001111)2 = (0000X4X3X2X1 )2 We called that (00001111)2 is a mask which only makes low 4 bits to work.

(1) (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1 )2 or (00001111)2 = ( X8X7X6X51111)2 

(2) (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1 )2 xor (00001111)2 = (X8X7X6X5X4'X3'X2'X1' )2 

(3) ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1 )2 and (11110000)2 ) or (not (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1 )2 and (00001111)2 ) =           	  (X8X7X6X5X4'X3'X2'X1' )2

## 使用维基百科，解释以下概念。

1)Logic gate 

In electronics, a logic gateis an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operationon one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. 

2)Boolean algebra

In mathematicsand mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebrain which the values of the variables are the truth values *true* and *false*, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively. 

3)Flip-flop

中文翻译为：触发器

In electronics, a flip-flop or latch is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. A flip-flop is a bistable multivibrator. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Flip-flops and latches are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.

## How many bits information does a SR latch store?
